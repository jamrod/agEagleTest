# agEagleTest

a web application that displays a map and weather data

## Requirements

### Eng-Test

Thank you for participating in the ageagle engineering test. We would like you to build an application that has the following features:

### API:

    Create a REST api that returns a number of random lat and long points with weather data.
        The consumer of the api should be able to specifty the number of returned points
        Weather data can be pulled via an api from Open Weather Map
        Random numbers should be retreived from an outside source ie: Random.org api

### Webapp:

    Create a webapp that consumes the api that you created and displays the data.

### Notes:

    We do not require that the web application be separate from the API in terms of servers. We do, however, want to see separate endpoints for getting the data and rendering the data
    Do this test in what ever language(s) and way you feel comfortable in. Ideally the UI portion is a webframework of some form
    Use this test as a showcase of good development practices
    Please include instructions on how to run your application as a part of submitting

### Helpful Hints:

    Mapbox is a great tool to use for rendering maps
    Dont forget there are only certian valid numbers for a lat / long

### Submitting:

    Email careers@ageagle.com with a link to a public git repositry
