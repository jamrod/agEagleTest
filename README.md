# agEagleTest

a web application that displays weather data

### Notes:

    We do not require that the web application be separate from the API in terms of servers. We do, however, want to see separate endpoints for getting the data and rendering the data
    Do this test in what ever language(s) and way you feel comfortable in. Ideally the UI portion is a webframework of some form
    Use this test as a showcase of good development practices
    Please include instructions on how to run your application as a part of submitting

### Helpful Hints:

    Mapbox is a great tool to use for rendering maps
    Dont forget there are only certian valid numbers for a lat / long
